# Email-Scrape
A simple python tool that scrapes emails from PDFs, websites, and text files.

## TODO:
* Add web scraping functionality
* Add PDF scraping functionality
* Fix formatting of emails returned (need to remove the domain types being returned in the tuples and convert the returned emails into a list of ordinary elements)
* Add more descriptive documentation in code
